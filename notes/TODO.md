## MVP

- [x] Create a browse page
- [x] Create an about page
- [x] Host
- [x] For GPT-3 prompts, we probably want just input and output, and an optional description
- [x] Add a navbar on all pages
- [] Style the navbar better
- [] Fix style on the prompt details page
  - [x] This is in dark mode for some reason
  - [x] The prompt being displayed is very ugly
  - [x] Probably the best way to display a prompt is like this: https://www.notion.so/React-Components-Generator-015f97ef737e498a8d4d40ff8ccce288
- [] Fix style on the browse page
    - [x] The cards are ugly
    - [x] The cards are clickable but it's not obvious on hover
    - [] The cards should be rendered uniformly, all of the same size.
- [] Figure out a way to prepopulate data into this somehow, so that it's partially useful.
- [] The best interface for text prompts is livegrep-style search.
- [] Where do I show description?
- [] ratelimiting on the API, although right now just about any traffic would kill the site
- [] Need a favicon
- [] The loading screen on the prompt page shouldn't take over the entire page.
